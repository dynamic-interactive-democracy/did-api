1. Bring the pictures/headlines from the groups from picture forming into column 3 of the helping board for proposal shaping. Column 1 and 2 are automatically transferred.
2. Round/pop-up/brainstorm: For each picture, propose possible solutions/policies/rules/procedures to column 4
3. Reaction round - modify the proposals, combine them, discard some ideas etc and move them to column 5.
4. Repeat step 3 as many times as needed, while you create as many columns as needed until you reach one or more final proposals. A final proposal states
  - What's going to happen
  - What are we seeking to accomplish (evaluation criteria)
  - Who is responsible for manifesting it
  - When does the term begin
  - When is the term up
5. Move the final proposal into the decision making stage. If there is more than one proposal clone the card so the result is one card containing all the history for each final proposal.

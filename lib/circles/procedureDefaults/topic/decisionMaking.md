1. Present proposal
2. Round/pop-up: Clarifying questions
3. Round: Quick reactions
4. If needed further modifications may be done to the proposal (by creating a temporary helping circle or delegating it to one or more people from the circle)
5. Consent round. (Thumbs up/down). Approval of a proposal requires consent from every member of the circle.
6. If everybody consents (Thumbs up):        Move into agreement stage to finish administration of this decision.
7. UPS   (Thumbs down)     **OBJECTION â€” WHAT TO DO??? (could be a link to a pop-up with the text below)**
8. Check: Reasoned objection or personal preference? (A reason for objection may be that a proposal is against the aim or values of the network/circle, that there is a better way of achieving the same or that consenting to the proposal would prevent a member from staying in the circle/network. Personal preferences usually isn't sufficient reason for an objection, but an organisation may of cause create their own policy for this. If the picture-forming and proposal shaping is done appropriately, most personal preferences would already have been heard and incorporated in the proposal to the extent it is possible and makes sense.)
9. Check: Will an abbreviation of the period remove the objection?
10. Check: Which parameters may be changed so that the proposal will be "Good enough for now and safe enough to try"
11. Check: Did we miss any dimensions or needs, drivers or tensions? Review previous  stages if needed. 
12. Create a temporary helping circle to find a solution.
13. Do a round: What can we do about this? It is a joint responsibilty to find a solution.
14. Keep working on it until you have consent even if you start over again.
